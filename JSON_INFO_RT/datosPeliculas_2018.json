Mudbound follows the McAllan family, newly transplanted from the quiet civility of Memphis and unprepared for the harsh demands of farming. Despite the grandiose dreams of Henry, his wife Laura struggles to keep the faith in her husband's losing venture. Meanwhile, Hap and Florence Jackson -- sharecroppers who have worked the land for generations -- struggle bravely to build a small dream of their own despite the rigidly enforced social barriers they face.
